    <p style="background-color:white"> My name is Alexandra but I've gone by Al since the day I left high school; which for me was almost
    10 years ago. I've done a lot since including going to film school, travelling the world and working at my dream job.
    Sadly due to the Covid-19 pandemic
    the travel industry has been nearly bankrupt and my career as a flight attendant has been put on hold. In the meantime I've decided to pursue soemthing that interested me the last time I went to college, which was programming. Now I have to opportunity to combine two things that interest me greatly: video games and programming. <br /><br />
	Things about myself that might be interesting to you would be that I have a great and undying love of hockey, specifically the Pittsburgh Penguins. I try to go to as many of their games as possible, I will and have travelled ridiculous distances to watch hockey. <br /> Another passion of mine is of course travel and I've been to many places already and when it is possible to travel again there are still many places I wish to go. I've been to Asia, Europe, North America, Central America and most of the Caribbean. While Antartica seems unlikely, I'd like to get to Afria and Australia soon. </p>
